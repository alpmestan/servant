servant
=======

A simple and extensible library to define and generate resource/REST oriented web-services just from the database functions. This is the core package and thus isn't tied to a particular database or web-framework. It actually just depends on **base** right now.

See [here](http://alpmestan.com/servant/) for documentation.
